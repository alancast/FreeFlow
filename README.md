# FreeFlow/Sheriff

FreeFlow/Sheriff is a mobile options and equities trading application.  It allows users to place trades from the comfort of their homes/smartphones.  We at Wolverine are able to provide this service for free because it is the uniformed order flow that is far more valuable to us than the commissions we may be able to earn.   We already have deals with other retail brokers to pay them for this kind of flow.  If we can cut out the middleman and get our order flow straight from the customer, we stand to make another metric shit-ton of money; some of which could be used to fund substantial raises for the SmartRouter team ;)

This was first built as a Hack Days project on the 23/24 of July 2014 by Vishnu Indukuri, Alex Lancaster, and Paul Scheid.
